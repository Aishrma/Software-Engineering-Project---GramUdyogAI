including authentication, data processing, and response generation.

FLOW DESCRIPTION:

1. User Navigation (Steps 1-2):
   - User navigates to Business Suggestion page
   - Frontend verifies JWT token with Auth Middleware

2. Form Submission (Steps 3-4):
   - User fills and submits the suggestion form
   - Frontend sends POST request with authorization header

3. Authentication (Steps 5-8):
   - Router validates user session
   - Auth Middleware verifies credentials with Database
   - Authorization granted to proceed

4. Data Processing (Steps 9-11):
   - Core Logic fetches user profile from Database
   - Enhanced LLM Service prepares AI prompt
   - Request sent to External AI Service (OpenAI/Groq)

5. AI Processing (Steps 12-13):
   - AI Service processes the request
   - Returns generated business suggestions

6. Data Persistence (Steps 14-17):
   - Core saves suggestions to Database
   - Notification Service creates user notification
   - Notification stored in Database

7. Response Delivery (Steps 18-20):
   - Suggestions returned to Frontend
   - Frontend parses and formats data
   - User views the rendered suggestions

8. Alternative Flow - Translation (Steps 21-26):
   - User requests translation
   - System translates content via AI Service
